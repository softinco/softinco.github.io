Soft Tiny Co is a small ISV company consisting of two people at the moment =). But, anyway, we are proudly announcing our first product — [Dependency Explorer](/products/dependency-explorer)! This product is about to be released soon, as it will go version 1.0. Its current feature set is quite small, but if the product will be recognized as the useful tool and generate some revenue, the feature set will definitely grow (according to existing road map which will also be influenced by active users)!
